# Basic Secure End-to-End Encrypted Chat System

This project implements a secure chat system with end-to-end encryption, mutual authentication, and server-signed key exchanges. It provides a robust platform for private and authenticated communication between users.

## Overview

This secure chat system uses a hybrid encryption approach combining RSA and DES algorithms:

- [RSA](https://github.com/nabielvna/RSA) - Asymmetric cryptography algorithm used for key exchange and digital signatures
- [DES](https://github.com/nabielvna/DES) - Symmetric-key algorithm used for encrypting message content

The system consists of several Python modules working together:

- `client.py`: Client-side implementation with E2E encryption and user interface
- `server.py`: Server implementation handling connections and message routing
- `e2e.py`: End-to-end encryption implementation using hybrid RSA/DES
- `nonce_manager.py`: Handles mutual authentication challenges
- `server_signature_manager.py`: Manages server signing of client keys

## Features

- End-to-end encryption using hybrid RSA/DES
- Mutual authentication between clients and server
- Server-signed public key distribution
- Real-time user status updates
- Message integrity verification
- Protection against man-in-the-middle attacks
- Secure message routing
- Simple command-line interface
- Session management
- Automatic key exchange

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Socket library (built-in)
- Threading library (built-in)
- JSON library (built-in)
- Base64 library (built-in)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nabielvna/Secure-Chat.git
cd Secure-Chat
```

2. Ensure all files are in the correct directory structure:
```
secure-chat/
├── client.py
├── server.py
├── core/
│   ├── e2e.py
│   ├── nonce_manager.py
│   └── server_signature_manager.py
├── crypto/
│   ├── DES.py
│   └── RSA.py
└── utils/
    └── log.py
```

3. Start the server:
```bash
python server.py
```

4. In separate terminal windows, start clients:
```bash
python client.py
```

## Usage

### Starting the Server

1. Run the server script:
```bash
python server.py
```
2. The server will start listening on localhost:5000 by default

### Using the Client

1. Start the client:
```bash
python client.py
```

2. Enter your username when prompted

3. Send messages using the format:
```
recipient:message
```

4. Type 'quit' to exit

### Commands
- `quit`: Exit the chat client
- `recipient:message`: Send a message to specific user

## Technical Details

### Security Architecture

1. End-to-End Encryption
   - RSA 2048-bit key pairs for key exchange
   - DES for message content encryption
   - Hybrid encryption scheme for efficiency
   - Unique session keys per message

2. Authentication System
   - Nonce-based challenge-response
   - Mutual authentication between client and server
   - Server-signed client public keys
   - Session timeout management

3. Message Security
   - Length-prefix framing for secure transmission
   - Message signing for integrity
   - E2E encryption for privacy
   - Server acts only as message router

### Implementation Details

#### Client Architecture
- Handles user registration and authentication
- Manages E2E encryption/decryption
- Maintains list of active users
- Verifies server signatures
- Handles key exchange

#### Server Architecture
- Manages client connections
- Routes encrypted messages
- Signs client public keys
- Broadcasts user status updates
- Handles session management

#### Communication Protocol
1. Client Connection:
   - Nonce challenge from server
   - Client response with encrypted nonce
   - Server verification
   - Client registration
   - Key package distribution

2. Message Flow:
   - Sender encrypts with recipient's public key
   - Server routes encrypted message
   - Recipient decrypts with private key
   - Message integrity verification

## Security Considerations

1. Trust Model
   - Server is trusted for routing only
   - Server cannot read message content
   - Clients verify all signatures

2. Key Management
   - Fresh keys generated per session
   - Server signs client public keys
   - Automatic key exchange

3. Known Limitations
   - No perfect forward secrecy
   - No message persistence
   - Basic key management

## Error Handling

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Connection failures
- Authentication errors
- Encryption/decryption failures
- Invalid messages
- User verification errors
- Session timeouts
